Title: Individualized Prediction Errors and Intervals for Random Forests
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional
    prediction intervals, and conditional error distributions for random forest
    predictions. The errors, intervals, and distributions are conditional in
    the sense that each error and interval is specific to the individual
    observation whose response is being predicted. More details can be found in
    Lu and Hardin (2019+) (in preparation).
