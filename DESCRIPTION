Title: Individualized Prediction Errors and Intervals for Random Forests
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates both conditional mean squared prediction errors and 
    conditional prediction intervals for random random forest predictions. The
    prediction errors and intervals are conditional in the sense that each error
    and interval is specific to the individual observation whose response is
    being predicted. More details can be found in Lu and Hardin (2019+)
    (in preparation).
