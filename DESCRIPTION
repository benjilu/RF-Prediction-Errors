Title: A Unified Framework for Random Forest Prediction Error Estimation
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates the conditional error distributions of random forest
    predictions and common parameters of those distributions, including
    conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, and 
    conditional quantiles, by out-of-bag weighting of out-of-bag prediction
    errors as proposed by Lu and Hardin (2019+) <arXiv:1912.07435>.
    This package is compatible with several existing packages that
    implement random forests in R.
