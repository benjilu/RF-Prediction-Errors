Title: A Unified Framework for Random Forest Prediction Error Estimation
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates the conditional error distributions of random forest
    predictions and common parameters of those distributions, including
    conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, and 
    conditional prediction intervals. The error distributions and associated
    parameters are conditional in the sense that each distribution is 
    specific to the individual observation whose response is being predicted.
    More details can be found in Lu and Hardin (2019+).
