Title: A Unified Framework for Random Forest Prediction Error Estimation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates the conditional error distributions of random forest
    predictions and common parameters of those distributions, including
    conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, and 
    conditional quantiles. This package is compatible with several 
    existing packages that implement random forests in R.
